Overview
--------

This package contains cython code implementing a geometric variational integrator for the dynamics of point vortices of the sphere.  The discrete equations of motion live on the three-dimensional sphere/the Lie group SU(2), which allows for techniques from discrete Lagrangian mechanics to be used.  More information can be found in the following preprint:
